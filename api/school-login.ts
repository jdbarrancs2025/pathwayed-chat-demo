/**
 * Give a covered student every prep module their GRADE qualifies for. The school
 * bought a grade-band license, so grade decides this, not the school id: grade 12
 * gets SAT (band 9-12), grade 7 gets HSPT + ISEE (band 6-8). A new school needs no
 * config and a new module in the registry is picked up automatically.
 *
 * Nobody paid Stripe for these, so the rows carry a null subscription item and a
 * null ends_at. Writes run as the service role (which bypasses the read-only RLS
 * on prep_entitlements, exactly like the Stripe webhook); nothing here is
 * client-callable.
 *
 * Idempotent and never a downgrade:
 *   - an entitlement already in an entitled status is left untouched;
 *   - a Stripe-backed row (non-null stripe_subscription_item_id) is never written,
 *     even when it is canceled, so real billing state always wins;
 *   - a lapsed school-covered row (canceled, no Stripe item) is reactivated.
 * The insert is an ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING upsert on the (student_id, module_id)
 * unique constraint, so two concurrent sign-ins cannot duplicate a row.
 *
 * Never throws: a student who cannot practice is a far smaller problem than a
 * student who cannot sign in, so every failure is logged and swallowed.

 * another grade. Accounts in this product really do own several children (one holds
 * six today), so this adopts ONLY when the account owns exactly one unlinked row.
 * Zero means there is nothing to adopt and the caller inserts. Two or more means the
 * Dean student cannot be told apart from their siblings, so the caller inserts a
 * fresh row and this logs the ambiguity for a human to merge. Guessing is the one
