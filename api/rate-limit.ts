/**
 * Per-user rate limiting for the LLM endpoints.
 *
 * IN-MEMORY, AND HONEST ABOUT WHAT THAT BUYS. State lives in the serverless
 * instance, so the effective ceiling is (limit x number of warm instances) rather
 * than a hard global cap, and it resets on cold start. That is a real limitation,
 * not a detail: this stops a runaway client, a stuck retry loop, and casual abuse.
 * It does NOT stop a determined attacker who can force fan-out across instances.
 *
 * It is deliberately the cheap version: no table, no migration, no Redis
 * dependency, no extra round trip on a latency-sensitive streaming path. Combined
 * with requiring a valid Supabase session it removes the open-endpoint problem;
 * a durable global limiter is a separate, larger piece of work (see the report).
