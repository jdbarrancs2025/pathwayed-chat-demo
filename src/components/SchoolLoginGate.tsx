 * After any SSO login, ask our server whether this verified email is a covered
 * school student (domain -> school_id map + Dean resolve, all server-side). If so,
 * establish the school session (Stripe bypass + authoritative grade) and route the
 * student to their learning home. Unknown domains / B2C logins fall through — this
 * NEVER blocks the normal consumer flow. Renders nothing.
 *
 * Shares the single memoized ensureSchoolCheck with Welcome's redirect, so a
 * covered 9-12 student is routed HERE and never sent to the parent consent flow.
