/**
 * Drives every check question in a lesson through its whole life: decide, fetch,
 * show, grade, record, hand back to the conversation.
 *
 * WHERE THE WRITE HAPPENS, AND WHY HERE. The attempt is recorded from the BROWSER
 * through the existing recordQuestionAttempt, under the same owns_student RLS
 * policy, with the same shape Practice writes. No new server credential is
 * introduced. api/chat.ts stays a stateless proxy with no database access at all:
 * it has no authentication today, so attaching the service role to it would let any
 * caller fabricate graded attempts for any student_id, which is precisely the
 * evidence the parent and school dashboards now depend on.
 *
 * WHO STARTS A CHECK. Both Nikki and the app. Her [[check]] marker is the better
 * signal, because she can see that something just landed, so it skips the cooldown.
 * But a lesson cannot depend on her volunteering: the prompt tells her most turns
 * should have no check, and across the live database that produced zero recorded
 * checks in every session ever run. So the cadence also fires on its own once the
 * window opens. Nikki moves checks earlier; she is not what makes them happen.
 *
 * NO CREDIT FOR PARTICIPATION. The ONLY write is in `pick`, from a real tap on a
 * real choice, graded against the stored key. A card that is shown and ignored, a
 * lesson abandoned mid-question, a hint, a conversation about the answer: none of
 * them record anything, correct or otherwise. Silence is never evidence.
