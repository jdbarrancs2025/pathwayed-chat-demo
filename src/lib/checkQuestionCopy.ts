/**
 * The turn the app sends on the child's behalf after they answer a check question.
 *
 * It is written in the child's voice because it appears in the transcript as their
 * message, and because Nikki's next turn should respond to a person, not to a
 * status code. It states what they picked and whether it was right, so Nikki does
 * not have to guess and does not re-ask the question. Correctness comes from the
 * stored answer key, never from Nikki's reading of it.
