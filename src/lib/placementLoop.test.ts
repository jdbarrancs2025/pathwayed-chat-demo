/**
 * Regression tests for the Skills Building placement loop.
 *
 * A grade 12 student answered ten diagnostic questions across two hours, every one
 * of them the SAME skill, and never got past the opening screen. Three defects
 * lined up to do that, and each gets a test here:
 *
 *   1. listPracticeableSkills read the whole published catalogue unbounded, so
 *      PostgREST capped it at max-rows and silently hid most skills. Grade 12
 *      collapsed to one visible skill.
 *   2. A one-skill rung produced a one-question run, below PLACEMENT_MIN_QUESTIONS.
 *   3. A below-floor run is discarded rather than seeded, and the gate deciding
 *      whether to offer placement read mastery only, so it re-offered the identical
 *      run forever.
