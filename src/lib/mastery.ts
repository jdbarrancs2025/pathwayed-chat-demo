// Evidence-driven mastery read API. The AUTHORITATIVE computation lives in the
// Postgres function recompute_skill_mastery() (migration 0010), which recomputes
// from graded question_attempts on every graded attempt. This module only READS
// the stored result and derives one purely time-relative fact — whether a spaced
// re-check is now DUE — which must not require a recompute to become true.
//
// The two bars (mirrored here for callers/tests; the DB is the source of truth):
//   ADVANCE  — >= 70% over >= 5 graded, non-diagnostic attempts.
//   MASTERED — >= 85% over >= 8 quality attempts, held on a spaced re-check
//              (>= 3 days later, >= 2 further attempts, still >= 85%).
