 * Practice SAT — Phase 3 (HIGH SCHOOL ONLY): Reading & Writing + Math.
 *
 * A shortened, deferred-scored practice test assembled entirely from our own
 * authored bank (published `generated_questions`) via the SAME serve path normal
 * practice uses — never real-SAT text. It runs a short Reading & Writing section
 * (passage-backed evidence-based reading + Standard-English-Conventions writing)
 * then the Math section, SAT-shaped at small scale. Scoring is raw correct/total
 * per section + overall — NO scaled 400–1600 score, because the R&W bank only
 * covers two of the four SAT R&W domains (see the counts below). Read-only apart
 * from writing missed skills into the focus mechanism (Phase 2).
