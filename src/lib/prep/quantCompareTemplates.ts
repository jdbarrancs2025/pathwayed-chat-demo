/**
 * Prep quantitative-comparison bank — HSPT-style comparisons and ISEE
 * "Column A / Column B" quantitative comparisons, grades 6-8.
 *
 * The quant analogue of verbalTemplates.ts, held to the SAME bar: every item has
 * 4 choices, exactly one correct, and THREE distractors that are each a specific
 * wrong path a real 7th grader takes — never a random pick. Here the FOUR choices
 * are always the same four relationship sentences ("Column A is greater", ...),
 * so there is no length or wording tell by construction; buildPrepQuestion still
 * balances WHICH position holds the correct answer, and every wrong relationship
 * carries a misconception token explaining why a careless student would land on
 * THAT relationship for THIS item.
 *
 * The hard part is the "cannot be determined" items: each one is written to LOOK
 * determinable (a variable that seems pinned down but could be a fraction, zero,
 * or negative; an average that hides its spread). A student who computes one case
 * feels sure — and is wrong. The solution for those proves indeterminacy with two
 * cases that disagree.
 *
 * Deterministic: fixed content, no runtime randomness. Served through the same
 * generated_questions path as the rest of the prep bank.
