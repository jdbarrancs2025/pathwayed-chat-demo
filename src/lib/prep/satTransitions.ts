/**
 * Prep verbal question bank — SAT Digital "Expression of Ideas: Transitions".
 *
 * The sibling of sentenceCompletionTemplates.ts, held to the SAME bar: every item
 * is a short 2-3 sentence passage with a blank "______" where a transition word or
 * phrase belongs, four choices, exactly one correct, and THREE distractors that are
 * each a SPECIFIC wrong path — a transition that misreads the logical relationship
 * between the ideas (a contrast word where the ideas agree, a cause word where there
 * is no cause and effect, and so on). Never a random or equally-valid transition:
 * the correct choice is uniquely right, each distractor clearly wrong.
 *
 * Choices are served through the same generated_questions path as the rest of the
 * bank. The CORRECT choice is listed FIRST with no token; buildPrepQuestion reorders
 * positions by slot so there is no positional tell. Every distractor token has an
 * explanation in SAT_TRANSITIONS_MISCONCEPTIONS below (a test asserts coverage).
