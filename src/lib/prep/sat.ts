/**
 * SAT structure — the DIGITAL SAT (current College Board format, Bluebook).
 *
 * The digital SAT is section-adaptive with two sections, each delivered in two
 * equal-length, back-to-back modules:
 *   Reading and Writing — 2 modules × 27 questions × 32 min  (54 q, 64 min)
 *   Math                — 2 modules × 22 questions × 35 min  (44 q, 70 min)
 * Total 98 questions, 134 minutes, with a short break between the two sections
 * (after Reading and Writing, before Math). A handful of questions per section are
 * unscored pretest items indistinguishable to the test-taker; the counts here are
 * the totals a student actually sees per module, which is what we model.
 *
 * We model each module as its own timed section (the timed engine grades one
 * section at a time). We do NOT implement the between-module adaptivity (module 2's
 * difficulty keyed to module 1) — that is out of scope for the practice engine; each
 * module is an independent timed run drawn from the section's question types.
 *
 * questionTypes are the four official content domains per section, used by the prep
 * engine's stand-in mapping (PREP_SKILLS). SAT-specific R&W formats (transitions,
 * words-in-context) are authored prep skills; the rest lean on close existing banks.
