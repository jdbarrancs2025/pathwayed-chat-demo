/**
 * Prep verbal question bank — Sentence Completions (ISEE-style), grades 6-8.
 *
 * The sibling of verbalTemplates.ts, held to the SAME bar: every item has 4
 * choices, exactly one correct, and THREE distractors that are each a specific
 * wrong path a real 6-8 grader takes — never a random word. Each frame carries a
 * CLEAR context clue (contrast, causation, or restatement) that determines the
 * answer, and every distractor fits GRAMMATICALLY but VIOLATES that clue.
 *
 * Frames come in two shapes: one-blank (choices are single words) and two-blank
 * (choices are word PAIRS rendered "word1 . . . word2"). Both are served through
 * the same generated_questions path as the rest of the bank. The CORRECT choice is
 * listed FIRST with no token; buildPrepQuestion reorders positions by slot so there
 * is no positional tell. Every distractor token has an explanation in
 * SENTENCE_COMPLETION_MISCONCEPTIONS below (a test asserts coverage).
