/**
 * Prep verbal question bank — Logic & Verbal Classification (HSPT verbal reasoning),
 * grades 6-8.
 *
 * Sibling of verbalTemplates.ts (Synonyms/Antonyms), held to the SAME bar: every
 * item has 4 choices, exactly one correct, and THREE distractors that are each a
 * specific wrong path a real 7th grader takes — never a random word.
 *
 *   • Logic — short deductive statements followed by a conclusion to evaluate
 *     (transitive syllogisms, ordering, conditional traps). Every distractor is a
 *     conclusion that does NOT follow but looks like it does: a reversed
 *     implication, an over-generalization, a smuggled-in assumption, or a mixed-up
 *     order.
 *   • Verbal Classification — "which word belongs with the group" / "which word
 *     does NOT belong". Every distractor is a word a student picks by sorting on
 *     the WRONG attribute, by grabbing something merely associated, by reaching for
 *     a category that is too broad, or (in odd-one-out) by flagging a word that
 *     actually DOES belong.
 *
 * Self-contained: LOGIC_MISCONCEPTIONS holds every token used by BOTH skills, so
 * the test can assert coverage without importing the shared misconceptions layer.
