/**
 * Prep verbal question bank — SAT Digital "Craft & Structure: Words in Context".
 *
 * The sibling of sentenceCompletionTemplates.ts, held to the SAME bar: every item
 * has 4 choices, exactly one correct, and THREE distractors that are each a
 * specific wrong path a real SAT taker (grades 9-12 reading level) is tempted by —
 * never a random word and never an equally-valid synonym. Each item is a short 1-3
 * sentence passage whose CONTEXT (a defining clue, a contrast, or an example) makes
 * exactly one precise word the best fit for the blank "______". Every distractor
 * fits the grammar but is ruled OUT by that context for a nameable reason.
 *
 * Choices are single words. The CORRECT choice is listed FIRST with no token;
 * buildPrepQuestion reorders positions by slot so there is no positional tell.
 * Every distractor token has an explanation in SAT_WORDS_IN_CONTEXT_MISCONCEPTIONS
 * below (a test asserts coverage).
 *
 * NOTE on taxonomy: the exported skill keeps subject 'prep-verbal' and gradeBand
 * '6-8' to match the isolated prep taxonomy the seed pipeline and tests expect. The
 * grade-band here is the content authoring band, deliberately separate from the
 * SAT reading level of the passages and from purchase eligibility.
