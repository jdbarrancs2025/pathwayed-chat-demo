/**
 * The grade ladder — how far UP a student may reach, and when they have earned

 * rule here is unit-tested without a database.
 *
 * Two principles, both from the product brief:
 *
 *   MASTERY IS TRUTH. Grade is a default, never a cap. A student who has cleared
 *   the ADVANCE bar on everything at their working grade gets the next grade up.
 *
 *   CEILING ONLY, NO FLOOR. There is deliberately no symmetric lower bound: a hard
 *   floor would re-trap a struggling student, and it would break the prep engine,
 *   which routes a grade 9 student to grade 3 Multiplication for HSPT arithmetic on
 *   purpose. Downward reach stays available, it just is not the DEFAULT: below the
 *   student's own band a skill must justify itself with evidence.
