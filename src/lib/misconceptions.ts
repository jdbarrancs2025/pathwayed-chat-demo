/**
 * Question Engine, Stage 4 — explanation-by-misconception.
 *
 * Maps the misconception token recorded on a wrong answer (the
 * `chosen_misconception_token` carried on each served choice and stored on
 * question_attempts) to a short, encouraging, kid-appropriate nudge that targets
 * THAT specific mistake — not a generic "the answer is N". Tokens are defined per
 * template in src/lib/mathTemplates.ts; every token there has an entry here (a
 * unit test asserts coverage so the two can't drift). Plain text only (rendered
 * as-is, no math/markdown). Returns null for an unknown/absent token so the
 * caller falls back to the plain verdict + worked solution.
