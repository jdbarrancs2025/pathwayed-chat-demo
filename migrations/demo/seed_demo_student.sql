-- seed_demo_student.sql  --  DEMO DATA ONLY. Run by hand in the SQL editor.
-- Project: papiowjjoyhnbyhgtbxq  (tutoring / pathwayed-chat-demo)
--
-- Creates ONE child profile named "Demo Student" on the family account
-- phillip.tomlin@dmvdream.org, grade 10, with placement already done: a spread
-- of mastery rows (strong, middling, weak), one in-progress focus skill, and a
-- little session history. Pairs with teardown_demo_student.sql.
--
-- IDENTIFYING THE DEMO ROWS
--   The child is the students row with first_name = 'Demo Student' owned by
--   that parent. Everything else is deleted by student_id, so teardown is exact.
--   No other child, and no other family, is touched.
--
-- WHY EACH PIECE IS HERE (do not trim these away)
--   * Mastery rows suppress the placement offer. KidHome calls hasAnyMastery()
--     and only offers the diagnostic when a grades 3-12 child has NO mastery
--     rows. Seeding mastery is what makes the diagnostic prompt disappear.
--     Note it is an OFFER, never forced, so this is belt and braces.
--   * above_grade_ok = true turns on SAT framing for a 9-12 student, and is
--     also what gates the Practice SAT entry point (see practiceSat.ts).
--   * active = true so the child is visible in the picker.
--   * school_covered stays FALSE. That column is not what bypasses billing:
--     the bypass reads isSchoolCovered() out of sessionStorage, which is only
--     written after a real Dean resolve. Setting it here would do nothing for
--     the gate and would misrepresent a B2C child as school licensed.
